    <h3>Descriptions</h3>
    <p>Forget about deep frying, and give your hush puppies a light update using an air fryer. They're just a bit denser
        in texture than deep frying, and look for a subtle hint of heat. They're the perfect sidekick to fried fish or
        shrimp, but they're equally good with a drizzle of honey.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>nonfat cooking spray
        </li>
        <li>1 cup yellow cornmeal</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1

            bottom of the air fryer basket with aluminum foil and spray with nonfat cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Step 2
            Stir cornmeal, flour, baking powder, salt, cayenne, and garlic powder together in a large bowl. Mix in onion
